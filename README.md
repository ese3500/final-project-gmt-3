## Final Project Proposal

### 1. Abstract

In a few sentences, describe your final project. This abstract will be used as the description in the evaluation survey forms.

Our project is a modern twist on the classic game of Truth or Dare, where we incorporate a lie detector to add an element of technology and excitement. The game follows the traditional rules, where players take turns choosing between answering a truth question or completing a dare. However, our version adds a technological twist.

Each participant has the opportunity to input their own questions for both truth and dare categories. These questions are then categorized accordingly and stored in the game's database. An algorithm shuffles these questions and presents them randomly to the players, ensuring a varied and unpredictable game experience.

When a player is asked a truth question, their response is not just taken at face value. Instead, the game employs a lie detector mechanism that measures the player's physiological responses, such as heart rate, sweat production, and possibly other parameters like facial expressions or voice pitch changes. These biometric indicators are analyzed in real-time to assess the likelihood of the player being truthful or deceptive in their answer.

Similarly, when a player is faced with a dare, they must complete the challenge and then answer whether they successfully completed the dare. If the player claims to have completed the dare, the lie detector is again used to verify the truthfulness of their statement.

In cases where the lie detector determines that a player has been untruthful, the game enforces a mild, safe electric shock as a penalty. This adds an element of risk and encourages players to be honest. Additionally, a servo mechanism is employed to visually indicate the result of the lie detector's analysis. The servo has two positions labeled "TRUTH" and "LIE," and it points to the corresponding label based on whether the player's answer is deemed truthful or deceptive.

Our Truth or Dare game with a lie detector aims to enhance the traditional gameplay with technology, making it more engaging and adding a layer of accountability for the players. It's a perfect blend of classic entertainment and modern innovation.

### 2. Motivation

What is the problem that you are trying to solve? Why is this project interesting? What is the intended purpose?

The goal of our project is to enhance the classic game of Truth or Dare by incorporating a lie detector, ensuring accountability and adding an element of technology-driven excitement. This idea addresses the issue of players potentially lying or not completing dares without consequences, which can diminish the game's thrill. By integrating a lie detector that analyzes physiological responses, we aim to make the game more engaging and truthful. Our project demonstrates how technology can modernize traditional social games, making them more interactive and enjoyable for participants.

We hope that the lie detector would be fully functional. 

### 7. Final Demo

What do you expect to achieve by the final demonstration or after milestone 1?

The truth or dare game, with most (hopefully all) of the features of the game, both on the software side but also on the hardware side.

### 8. Methodology

What is your approach to the problem?

We first analyzed the requirements for the project and figured out how we could best tackle the problem in an interesting and innovative way. After we decided on the prject we were analyzing the requirements for the game and the lie detector, ensuring we understand the key features and functionalities needed. We will then select and integrat the appropriate hardware, including biometric sensors for lie detection and mechanisms for the penalty system. The software development phase will involve creating the lie detection algorithm, randomizing questions, and designing a user-friendly interface. We follow an iterative process of prototyping, testing, and refining based on feedback to enhance the game's performance and user experience. Finally, we conduct extensive testing to validate the game's accuracy and safety before launching it and collecting user feedback for ongoing improvements.

### 10. Evaluation

What is your metric for evaluating how well your product/solution solves the problem? Think critically on this section. Having a boolean metric such as “it works” is not very useful. This is akin to making a speaker and if it emits sound, albeit however terrible and ear wrenching, declare this a success.
It is recommended that your project be something that you can take pride in. Oftentimes in interviews, you will be asked to talk about projects you have worked on.

To evaluate the effectiveness of our Truth or Dare game with a lie detector, we need to consider several metrics beyond a simple "it works" assessment. Those are specified below:

-Lie Detector Accuracy: Measure the percentage of correct detections
-User Satisfaction: test it on users and assess their satisfaction with the game interface, ease of use and overall enjoyment
-Safety of the electric shock module: Ensure that we uphold safety standards
-Technical Performance: Ensure that the response time, battery life, reliability are at a high level

By evaluating these metrics, we can determine the success of the Truth or Dare game with a lie detector in providing an accurate, safe, enjoyable, and engaging experience for players. This comprehensive evaluation approach ensures that the project is something we can take pride in and confidently discuss in interviews or other professional contexts.

### 3. Results

Our results were fairly satisfactory. The initial problem we set out to adress was to make sure that the integrity of the truth part of the game is kept, along with adding another level of fun and excitement to the game. We would say that we have achieved this. Just like every initial version of a project we were happy with a few things and not so much with others.
Happy: - Our initial plan of approach to this project was to modularize it (break it down to smaller parts) so that we are able to solve it one at a time and have rigorous testing. We are very happy about how we did this. We had several parts that we divided such as UART Communication, Heart rate sensing and analysis, Game Logic and user interface. This made it very easy to test each of these aspects independently which worked flawlessly. We faced some hickups with integraton hell with pin allocation and delays but we were able to sort it out. 

Not Happy: - Simply said, the heart rate monitor we chose was a big mistake. It is increadibly finicky, and acted as the sole point of faliure in our entire system. The rest of our system is perfectly functional. But after the demo we were able to improve on making it more stable by cleaning the surface and the hand before each read and narrowing down the perfect spot to place the sensor. With this we were able to see increadible improvement of stability which is demonstrated on our demo video.

Over all we beleive this project was very fun to make and with further refinement could bring more fun to people who play it.



#### 3.1 Software Requirements Specification (SRS) Results

Based on your quantified system performance, comment on how you achieved or fell short of your expected software requirements. You should be quantifying this, using measurement tools to collect data.

**-Storing Questions:** We have 2 arrays which store truth and lie questions. Whenever a truth question is requested to be displayed we access the truth array and whenever a dare question is requested we access the dare array. This is testable by the questions that are displayed and we could differentiate by seeing if the question we got was actually a truth or a dare question.

**-Randomizing Questions:** We are using the built-in c rand() function to pick random questions each time that a question is being requested. We had to adjust it to only give integer answers between 0 and array.length-1. This was also testable during the display, since the questions were well shuffled and we were not getting the same few questions over and over but we had a wide variety of questions.

**-Displaying Game Mode:** The display of the game mode happens each time that the MODE button is pressed. Each time that this button is pressed we have a variable that increments itself and even numbers correspond to truth mode and odd numbers correspond to dare mode. Then depending on which mode we are in, we use the LCD screen library to display it. This was tested by seeing the successful switch between TRUTH and DARE on the LCD screen each time that the MODE button is pressed. 

**-Displaying Questions:** The display of the questions is happening when the user is requesting a new question. That happens by reading the input of the NEXT QUESTION button (as specified in the HRS) which when the button is pressed we set a variable to 1 meaning that the user has requested a new question. Then based on the game mode variable and the question randomization, we pick a random question, clear the screen from the previous question and display it on the screen. This was testable by the LCD screen output where we 

**-LCD Screen Library:** We used the same graphics library that we created on lab 4, since we are using the same LCD screen and the library could handle our display requirements. We were able to test the outputs by seeing that it displays the game mode and question correctly.

**-Serial/Wired Communication:** For the serial communication we used UART to connect the two AVR boards. We used the 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit both on the transmitter and receiver end. We continuously send the most recent analysis result from the Atmega on the glove(a truth denoted by "T" or a Lie "L"). On the other Atmega (gamebox) we regularly poll the UART by doing a read each time we are in "Truth mode" and the "next question" button is pressed. Depending on whether a truth or lie is detected we handle the logic that controls the servo and LED.

**-Heart Beat Analysis and Lie Detection:**
After reading the data from ADC we observed its patterns and noticed that a heart beat happens each time the values exceed a threshold of around 550 units. We register this as a beat and we use an interrupt to measure the time between consecutive beats and simply calculate a running beats per minute. We then use this value's varying value of bpm as a way to measure whether a person is lying or not since peoples bpm tends to rise when they are caught in a lie. 

When it comes to testing this part we used Apple watch's bpm as a bench mark to measure the acuracy of our HRM sensor setup. We were often with in about 7% of what the Smart Watch was reporting. There seemed to be some sort of a delay in propagation of changes which was cool. We think this might be because the Watch is measuring closer to source, it might also be that we have a lot of relative delay in how fast we detect and calculate. 

Please see the following video of this in action of just the heart rate monitor being demonstrated.

**-Result Display:** The result display happened by receiving a T or L via the serial communication and then based on that we power up the buzzer and make the servo motor turn to either Liar or Squealer depending on the outcome. We were able to test that by seeing the inputs of the serial communication in the data visualizer and based on that see if the buzzer should buzz, and where the servo motor should be pointing and they were both functioning as expected.

**-Penalty Enforcement:** When we received an L from the serial communication, we turned the buzzer on, emitting a loud and annoying sound, which was verified by other people to be annoying, so we tested it that way.


#### 3.2 Hardware Requirements Specification (HRS) Results

Based on your quantified system performance, comment on how you achieved or fell short of your expected hardware requirements. You should be quantifying this, using measurement tools to collect data.

**Atmega328pb AVR- Xplained board: ** With the requirement of doing everything on bare metal, we ended up using two Atmega boards. We power them directly using their micro usb from a computer or a power bank. 

**-Button 1:** This is the MODE pull up button. Upon the pressing and releasing of this button an interrupts is triggered (set to get triggered when there is a rising or falling edge), which then increments the game mode variable. This was testable by an LED that we used to see if the button changes were being captured and by testing to see if the game mode variable was set correctly.

**-Button 2:** This is the NEXT QUESTION pull up button. Upon the pressing and releasing of this button an interrupts is triggered (set to get triggered when there is a rising or falling edge), which then increments the request new question variable. This was testable by an LED that we used to see if the button changes were being captured and by testing to see if the next question variable was set correctly to true (1).

**-LCD Screen:** We are using an LCD screen of type ST7735, which uses SPI for data transmission. The graphics library that we mentioned in the SRS, was sending the questions and the game mode to the screen. This was tested successfully by seeing the changes in what is displayed in the screen and the fact that questions were not overlapping each other.

**-Servo Motor:** We used fast PWM mode and were setting OCR2B, so that the servo motor moves between 2 positions (lie and truth-left and right). We were able to test that the pwm initialization together with the angle and the servo movement was successful by observing the angle of the servo and that it moved to the correct place based on the input to it.

**-Heart Rate Monitor:** Here we use the Atmega328PB's internal ADC to measure the varying voltage that is coming from the heart rate monitor's signal line. As mentioned and demonstrated above, to test, we measured the accuracy of our heart rate sensor by comparing it against a state of the art Apple Watch getting accurate with 7% margin of error. 

-whatever else
**-Buzzer:** We used the internally driven buzzer as a punishment and an indicator of a lie. We connected it to a pin that we set to high if the answer was a lie. This was testable by using the data visualizer of microchip, which showed if we were receiving an L from the serial communication which then successfully turned the buzzer on.
